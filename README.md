</p>About

SoundSync is a music-focused Android app designed to bring local library management, DJ-style audio analysis, playback controls, metadata enrichment, streaming-service browsing, cloud access, and music discovery tools into one place.

The project is aimed at people who keep their own music library but still want modern streaming and cloud conveniences without giving up direct access to their files.

«[!IMPORTANT]
SoundSync is under active development. Features, APIs, UI, metadata behaviour, and playback internals may change between builds.»

Features

Local music library

- Scan audio stored on the device.
- Browse the library by Songs, Albums, Artists, Playlists, and Folders.
- Browse directly through selected file locations instead of relying only on a flattened library view.
- Search the local library.
- Detect duplicate tracks to help avoid repeated imports.
- Inspect track and file properties.
- Create and manage local playlists.
- M3U playlist support with Rockbox-oriented path handling.

Playback

- Full-screen Now Playing experience.
- Background playback through an Android media playback service.
- Notification/media controls for playback outside the app.
- Queue-based continuous playback.
- Previous/next track navigation.
- Shuffle support.
- Repeat Off / Repeat All / Repeat One modes.
- Adjustable crossfade controls.
- Switchable album-art and waveform-focused Now Playing views.

Waveform, spectrogram, and audio analysis

- Track-specific waveform generation and caching.
- Rekordbox-inspired scrolling waveform display.
- Spectrogram generation and analysis.
- Local PCM analysis for BPM and musical key data.
- Camelot key representation.
- Bitrate and audio-quality inspection.
- Analysis metadata and confidence information where available.

Metadata enrichment

SoundSync uses the Apple iTunes Search API as the primary external catalogue for canonical track identification and textual metadata, paired with TheAudioDB v1 API for dedicated album cover artwork.

Metadata enrichment can include:

- Track title
- Artist and artist credits
- Album/collection information
- Apple Track, Collection, and Artist IDs
- TheAudioDB Album and Artist IDs
- Release date and year
- Track and disc number
- Record label
- Barcode and ISRC
- Primary genre and tags
- High-resolution square cover artwork through TheAudioDB (atomically cached and safely injected without re-encoding audio)

BPM and musical key are intentionally handled through local audio analysis or existing persisted values rather than being blindly replaced by remote catalogue data.

### DJ Tools & Real-Time Audio Processing

SoundSync provides fully functional DJ audio tools with real DSP and live PCM analysis:

- **Metronome**: Standalone high-precision monotonic audio clock with audible PCM click, user-selectable BPM (30–300 BPM), manual tap tempo sync, and drift-free operation.
- **Tap BPM / Tap Tempo**: Accurate tempo calculation from real-time taps using rolling interval averaging, outlier smoothing, and inactivity reset.
- **Key Converter**: Harmonic mixing tool translating standard musical keys (e.g., C Major, A Minor) to Camelot wheel notation and Open Key codes, with compatible key recommendations for harmonic DJ transitions.
- **RMS Meter**: Real decibel RMS loudness meter analyzing actual PCM audio frames, showing average dB, peak levels, and live visual meter indicators.
- **Clipping Detector**: PCM peak amplitude monitoring with configurable ceiling threshold (-0.1 dBFS), clipped sample counters, and true headroom calculation.
- **Dynamic Range Meter**: Audio dynamics analyzer calculating crest factor (peak-to-RMS ratio) and official DR dynamic range ratings.
- **Multipoint Parametric EQ**: Real Android platform audio effects equalizer with live low/mid/high frequency gain sliders (-12 dB to +12 dB) persisting across playback state changes and track transitions.
- **Haas Surround**: Controlled inter-channel micro-delay (1–30 ms) stereo widening effect with mono-safe phase control and zero playback glitches.

### Song Finds

Hear something good in a Reel, TikTok, YouTube video, Spotify link, SoundCloud link, or another app?

SoundSync appears in Android's system Share sheet to capture incoming links as Song Finds, allowing you to organize, tag, and locate tracks to add to your local library.

### Streaming Integrations

The app contains unified streaming browsing and playback with integrations for:

- **Spotify**: OAuth/PKCE authentication, saved library browsing, playlists, and track search.
- **SoundCloud**: Client ID API integration, stream URL resolution, and search.

> [!NOTE]
> Streaming features depend on third-party service APIs and user account credentials. SoundSync does not bypass service restrictions or DRM.

### AI Generation Tools

Quickly launch external AI music creation suites with track context copied to clipboard:
- **Suno**: Deep link opener with browser fallback.
- **ACE Studio**: Direct package opener with browser fallback.

### GitHub Releases & Update System

SoundSync connects directly to GitHub Releases for app version discovery and clean updates:

- **Automatic & Manual Checks**: Periodically queries GitHub Releases in the background (or on demand) and performs strict semantic version comparison (e.g., `1.10.0` > `1.9.0`).
- **Two-Step Update Flow**:
  1. *Update Notification*: Displays installed vs. available version, download size, and full release notes.
  2. *Prepare Update & Data Notice*: Explains the update procedure and explicitly warns that internal application data (settings, local database cache, internal playlists) will be reset upon uninstallation, while external audio files stored on device storage remain safe.
- **Clean Uninstall/Reinstall Sequence**: Verifies browser availability, launches the [Latest GitHub Release Page](https://github.com/jtmeaker-hash/Sound-sync/releases/latest) in an independent browser task, and immediately prompts Android's system package uninstall (`Intent.ACTION_DELETE`). No background APK downloading, package installer permissions, or in-app overwrites are performed.

### Navigation Architecture

SoundSync features a streamlined dual navigation architecture:

1. **Bottom Navigation Bar**:
   - **Local**: Songs, Albums, Artists, Playlists, and direct Folder file browsing.
   - **Finds**: Saved song links captured from external apps.
   - **Streaming**: Spotify and SoundCloud catalog integration.
   - **Spectrogram**: Real-time STFT frequency heatmap and cutoff inspection.

2. **Side Navigation Drawer (☰)**:
   - **AI Generation**: Suno & ACE Studio integrations.
   - **DJ Tools**: Metronome, Tap BPM, Key Converter, RMS Meter, Clipping Detector, Dynamic Range Meter, Multipoint EQ, Haas Surround.
   - **Streaming**: Spotify & SoundCloud configuration.
   - **Playback & Audio**: Adjustable crossfade, repeat modes, and shuffle controls.
   - **Library & Storage**: Storage sources, Apple & TheAudioDB metadata enrichment settings, MediaStore scanner, and cache cleanup.
   - **App & Interface**: Theme selection (Obsidian DJ Dark / Light / System) and GitHub Updates manager.

CI / GitHub Actions

The primary workflow is:

.github/workflows/build-apk.yml

It runs on pushes and pull requests targeting "main", and can also be started manually.

For release signing, configure the appropriate GitHub repository secrets rather than committing keystore passwords or private signing material.

Development status

SoundSync is evolving quickly. Current development is focused heavily on:

- Reliable continuous playback and queue behaviour.
- Accurate waveform-to-audio synchronisation.
- Stable track switching without stale audio state.
- Consistent BPM/key analysis coverage.
- Reliable metadata matching and enrichment.
- Smooth local-library browsing and search.
- Stable streaming/cloud authentication flows.
- Performance and crash reduction on real Android devices.

Bug reports with reproducible steps, device/Android version, logs, and the build version are especially useful.

Contributing

Contributions, testing, bug reports, and focused pull requests are welcome.

A useful contribution should ideally:

1. Describe the problem clearly.
2. Keep unrelated changes out of the same PR.
3. Preserve existing working playback and library behaviour.
4. Add or update tests when practical.
5. Confirm that "./gradlew testDebugUnitTest" passes.
6. Confirm that "./gradlew assembleDebug" succeeds.
