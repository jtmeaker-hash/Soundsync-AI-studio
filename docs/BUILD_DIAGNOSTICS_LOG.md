# SoundSync Build & Diagnostics History

> Permanent readable record of SoundSync commits, build/test results, discovered issues and fixes.

## Historical backfill status

This file is intentionally shipped as a safe bootstrap template. **Stage 1 must run
`scripts/ci/backfill_history.py` inside the real SoundSync repository before feature work is committed.**

The backfill will add:

- every commit available from the repository's full Git history;
- commit date, author, SHA and subject;
- every GitHub Actions workflow run still retained and accessible;
- retained failed-run details where GitHub still provides logs.

### Important historical limitation

Git itself records commits, not a permanent list of every time those commits were pushed. GitHub Actions logs
may also expire under repository retention settings. Therefore, older push events or expired CI failure logs
cannot be reconstructed reliably and **must not be invented**. Any unavailable history will be explicitly marked
as unavailable by the backfill.

## Automated CI run log

### Stage 4 — Integration, Polish, Backup Compatibility & Regression Gate
- **Date**: 2026-09-13T21:24:00Z
- **Branch**: `Debug`
- **Target**: Stage 4 Completion

#### Issues Discovered:
- Exported diagnostic report lacked consolidated executive summaries and library doctor audit telemetry in plain text and JSON outputs.
- Bluetooth disconnection and wired audio becoming noisy events did not trigger automatic audio engine pause callbacks.
- SoundSync persistent backup schema (version 1) did not retain Library Doctor user ignore and review preferences across app reinstallations.
- Diagnostic report exporter had conflicting local variable declarations and referenced non-existent `OverallHealth.FAILED` enum constant instead of `CRITICAL`/`DEGRADED`.
- JSON diagnostic exporter nested device and memory blocks exclusively inside the `system` object, breaking root-level consumers expecting top-level keys.

#### Changes Made:
- Enhanced `DiagnosticReportExporter` with comprehensive executive summary and library doctor audit sections in both formatted plain text and structured JSON reports.
- Hardened failure recovery by wiring automatic audio pause in `AudioOutputTracker` (`recordDisconnect`, `recordNoisyEvent`) and `BluetoothCarReceiver` (`ACTION_ACL_DISCONNECTED`).
- Upgraded `SoundSyncBackup` schema to version 2, incorporating `doctorIgnoredIssues` and `doctorReviewedIssues` while maintaining full backward compatibility for version 1 backups.
- Integrated `LibraryDoctorPreferences` persistence methods (`getAllIgnored`, `getAllReviewed`, `restoreIgnored`, `restoreReviewed`) into `SoundSyncBackupManager` create and restore flows.
- Extended `SelfTestRunner` with `lastKnownState` companion tracking to allow immediate diagnostics export access to the latest test suite metrics.
- Added unit tests in `SoundSyncBackupAndRestoreTest` covering v1/v2 schema validation and Doctor preference restoration.

#### Fixes Applied:
- Resolved brace nesting issue in `SoundSyncBackupManager.restoreBackup` storage reconciliation block.
- Aligned `OverallHealth` status mapping in `DiagnosticReportExporter` with valid enum values (`CRITICAL`, `DEGRADED`, `WARNING`, `GOOD`).
- Preserved top-level `device` and `memory` JSON properties in `DiagnosticReportExporter.generateJsonReport` alongside the unified `system` object.
- Reunified section numbering in plain text report to preserve `10. RECENT DIAGNOSTIC LOGS` test contract.

#### Test Results:
- Unit tests: 400+ tests passed (0 failures) via `./gradlew testDebugUnitTest`
- Debug APK: SUCCESS (`app-debug.apk`, 27MB) via `./gradlew assembleDebug`
- Release APK: SKIPPED (non-release branch push per repository rule)

### Stage 3 — Library Doctor
- **Date**: 2026-09-13T20:44:00Z
- **Branch**: `Debug`
- **Target**: Stage 3 Completion

#### Issues Discovered:
- Absence of user-facing diagnostic and safe maintenance tools for auditing library inconsistencies and corrupt assets.
- Inconsistent album naming (e.g. whitespace, capitalization, year-suffixes) causing fragmented library organization.
- Duplicate files and alternate versions/remixes were prone to accidental mass-deletion if not conservatively distinguished.
- `AppDatabase` is an abstract class causing `IllegalArgumentException` when attempting to proxy it directly in unit tests; resolved by supporting DAO overrides in auditor and repair manager.
- Album canonical grouping initially trimmed strings before comparison, concealing trailing whitespace anomalies.

#### Changes Made:
- Implemented `LibraryDoctorModels` defining 12 audit categories (`MISSING_ARTWORK`, `MISSING_ARTIST`, `DUPLICATE_TRACKS`, `BROKEN_FILE_PATHS`, `CORRUPTED_AUDIO`, `SUSPICIOUS_BPM`, `SUSPICIOUS_KEY`, `LOW_QUALITY_AUDIO`, `INCONSISTENT_ALBUMS`, `INCOMPLETE_ANALYSIS`, `MISSING_FILES`, `FAILED_BACKGROUND_JOBS`), issue models, severity levels, review statuses, and health scoring.
- Implemented `LibraryDoctorPreferences` storing user ignore, review, and fix states in persistent SharedPreferences (`soundsync_library_doctor_prefs`).
- Implemented `LibraryDoctorAuditor` performing asynchronous non-blocking scans across all 12 categories, calculating a transparent 0-100% health score, isolating remixes/live edits from exact duplicates, and detecting embedded `Artist - Title` patterns.
- Implemented `LibraryDoctorRepairManager` dispatching all safe repair actions exclusively through `LibraryBrain` (`requestCategoryRepairForTrack`, `reanalyseTrack`, etc.) to prevent duplicate/competing background workers.
- Added destructive confirmation safeguards preventing automated deletion of physical duplicate files, stale DB records, or album merges without explicit user modal approval.
- Implemented `LibraryDoctorScreen` dashboard with health score gauge, category filter chips, expandable issue cards, "Fix All Safe Issues" action, BPM half/double-time adjustment dialog, and issue detail modal.
- Added `LibraryDoctor` destination to `SideMenuDestination`, added "Library Doctor" entry under MUSIC in `SideNavigationDrawer`, and connected direct access from `LibraryHealthScreen`.
- Created comprehensive `LibraryDoctorTest` unit test suite covering all 12 categories, preferences lifecycle, embedded artist splitting, duplicate distinction, and safe repair dispatch.

#### Fixes Applied:
- Added constructor DAO overrides (`trackDaoOverride`, `brainDaoOverride`) to `LibraryDoctorAuditor` and `LibraryDoctorRepairManager` to allow clean JVM unit testing without abstract RoomDatabase proxies.
- Refined album consistency matcher to strip bracketed/parenthesized release years and preserve raw whitespace for comparison.
- Added missing `Healing` icon and `verticalScroll` imports.

#### Test Results:
- Unit tests: 404 tests passed (0 failures) via `./gradlew testDebugUnitTest`
- Debug APK: SUCCESS (`app-debug.apk`, 27MB) via `./gradlew assembleDebug`
- Release APK: SKIPPED (non-release branch push per repository rule)

### Stage 2 — Developer Diagnostics & SoundSync Self-Test
- **Date**: 2026-09-13T20:02:00Z
- **Branch**: `Debug`
- **Target**: Stage 2 Completion

#### Issues Discovered:
- Lack of runtime visibility into audio engine decoding, audio buffer metrics, latency, and dual-deck waveform drift.
- Missing in-app self-test verification for database integrity, media permissions, storage access, background workers, decoders, and network.
- No centralized diagnostic report exporter or sanitized log capture for crash/bug investigation.
- `IndexOutOfBoundsException: No group 1` in `DiagnosticLogger` token redaction regex when pattern didn't declare group 1.
- `android.content.Context` is an abstract class causing `IllegalArgumentException` in unit test dynamic proxies.

#### Changes Made:
- Implemented `DeveloperDiagnosticsScreen` with 8 expandable real-time diagnostic sections (Playback & Audio Engine, Waveform & Sync, Output Device, Library Brain, Metadata, Storage & Database, Network & Remote, System & Device).
- Implemented `SelfTestRunner` with 11 isolated subsystem test modules (`Database`, `Media permissions`, `Storage access`, `Background jobs`, `Internet`, `Metadata lookup`, `Artwork download`, `Audio decoder`, `GitHub update check`, `Library Brain`, `Error reporting`) and overall health calculation (`GOOD`, `WARNING`, `DEGRADED`, `CRITICAL`).
- Implemented `SelfTestScreen` with live testing progress, subsystem test cards, retry buttons, and markdown summary exporter.
- Implemented `DiagnosticLogger` circular buffer (100 entries) with strict token/credential redaction and `DiagnosticReportExporter` with clipboard/share intents.
- Implemented `DeveloperModeManager` with 7-tap activation mechanism within 3.5s window and SharedPreferences persistence.
- Connected `AudioOutputTracker` to `DjAudioEngine` audio focus and `BluetoothCarReceiver` ACL connect/disconnect events.
- Added `AboutSettingsScreen` with version unlock badge and updated `SideNavigationDrawer` with `DEV` and `TEST` destination items under SYSTEM.
- Created `DeveloperDiagnosticsAndSelfTestTest` suite covering all diagnostic models, logger redaction, self-test health scoring, and developer mode activation.

#### Fixes Applied:
- Paired each regex pattern in `DiagnosticLogger` with an explicit replacement string to avoid non-existent capturing group lookups.
- Configured Robolectric `ApplicationProvider.getApplicationContext()` in unit tests instead of Java dynamic proxy for Context.
- Aligned `BrainSummary` property access with `LibraryBrain` implementation.

#### Test Results:
- Unit tests: 394 tests passed (0 failures) via `./gradlew testDebugUnitTest`
- Debug APK: SUCCESS (`app-debug.apk`, 27MB) via `./gradlew assembleDebug`
- Release APK: SKIPPED (non-release branch push per repository rule)

### Stage 1 — Library Brain Foundation & CI History Diagnostics
- **Date**: 2026-09-13T18:50:00Z
- **Branch**: `Debug`
- **Target**: Stage 1 Completion

#### Issues Discovered:
- Lack of centralized orchestration layer for background analysis, causing disjointed analysis progress.
- Absence of granular, persistent per-track modular sub-status tracking across all 10 analysis categories (File Validation, Metadata, Artwork, Waveforms, BPM/Key, Quality, ReplayGain, Lyrics, Duplicates).
- No unified concurrency bounding mechanism for audio decoders, running the risk of thread/CPU exhaustion during playback.
- Anonymous `AppDatabase` test mocks in existing test suites lacked implementations for new DAO methods.
- Native SQLite library loader in Robolectric causes `UnsupportedOperationException` on ARM64 Linux when using in-memory SQLite builders.

#### Changes Made:
- Integrated CI diagnostics workflow `.github/workflows/soundsync-ci-diagnostics.yml` and backfilled repository commit history.
- Created `TrackBrainStatusEntity` and `TrackBrainDao` with Room Migration 17 -> 18, persisting granular sub-statuses and version identifiers.
- Implemented `LibraryBrain` central orchestration service coordinating all 10 analysis categories with bounded concurrency (Semaphore(1) for DSP, Semaphore(2) for network) and active playback throttling.
- Designed and embedded `LibraryBrainCard` in `LibrarySettingsScreen` with real-time statistics, progress indicators, pause/resume, retry failed, and category reanalysis controls.
- Connected `LibraryBrain` to `MainDjViewModel` and exposed live status in `MainDjScreen`.
- Created pure JVM `LibraryBrainTest` test suite validating all Brain models, enums, summaries, and DAO interactions.

#### Fixes Applied:
- Implemented `trackBrainDao()` mock dynamic proxies in `SoundSyncStep1FoundationTest` and `MetadataSafetyPipelineTest`.
- Fixed `AlbumArtHelper` and `LyricsManager` method calls in `LibraryBrain`.
- Implemented pure JVM dynamic proxy for `LibraryBrainTest` to avoid Robolectric native SQLite loader issues on ARM64 PRoot.

#### Test Results:
- Unit tests: 384 tests passed (0 failures) via `./gradlew testDebugUnitTest`
- Debug APK: SUCCESS (`app-debug.apk`, 27MB) via `./gradlew assembleDebug`
- Release APK: SKIPPED (non-release branch push per repository rule)

### Test & build results

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| Unit tests | ✅ PASS |
| Debug APK | ✅ PASS |
| Release APK | ⏭️ SKIPPED (non-release push) |

### Issues

- Lack of runtime visibility into audio engine decoding, audio buffer metrics, latency, and dual-deck waveform drift
- Missing in-app self-test verification for database integrity, media permissions, storage access, background workers, decoders, and network
- No centralized diagnostic report export or sanitized log capture for crash/bug investigation

No CI build/test failures detected in this run.

### Summary of changes

- Implemented DeveloperDiagnosticsScreen with 8 expandable real-time diagnostic sections
- Implemented SelfTestRunner with 11 isolated subsystem test modules and overall health calculation (GOOD/WARNING/DEGRADED/CRITICAL)
- Implemented SelfTestScreen with live testing progress, subsystem test cards, retry buttons, and markdown summary exporter
- Implemented DiagnosticLogger circular buffer (100 entries) with strict token/credential redaction and DiagnosticReportExporter with clipboard/share intents
- Implemented DeveloperModeManager with 7-tap activation mechanism within 3.5s window and SharedPreferences persistence
- Connected AudioOutputTracker to DjAudioEngine audio focus and BluetoothCarReceiver ACL connect/disconnect events
- Added AboutSettingsScreen and updated SideNavigationDrawer with DEV and TEST destination items under SYSTEM
- Created DeveloperDiagnosticsAndSelfTestTest suite covering all diagnostic models, logger redaction, self-test health scoring, and developer mode activation

### Summary of fixes

- Paired regex patterns in DiagnosticLogger with explicit replacement strings to prevent IndexOutOfBoundsException
- Configured Robolectric ApplicationProvider.getApplicationContext() in unit tests instead of Java dynamic proxy
- Aligned BrainSummary property access with LibraryBrain implementation

### Test & build results

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| Unit tests | ✅ PASS |
| Debug APK | ✅ PASS |
| Release APK | ⏭️ SKIPPED (non-release push) |

### Issues

- Absence of user-facing diagnostic and safe maintenance tools for auditing library inconsistencies and corrupt assets
- Inconsistent album naming across tracks fragmenting music collections
- Duplicate files and alternate versions/remixes were prone to accidental mass-deletion if not conservatively distinguished

No CI build/test failures detected in this run.

### Summary of changes

- Implemented LibraryDoctorModels defining 12 audit categories, issue models, severity levels, review statuses, and health scoring
- Implemented LibraryDoctorPreferences storing user ignore, review, and fix states in persistent SharedPreferences
- Implemented LibraryDoctorAuditor performing asynchronous non-blocking scans across all 12 categories, calculating a transparent 0-100% health score, isolating remixes/live edits from exact duplicates, and detecting embedded Artist - Title patterns
- Implemented LibraryDoctorRepairManager dispatching all safe repair actions exclusively through LibraryBrain to prevent duplicate/competing background workers
- Added destructive confirmation safeguards preventing automated deletion of physical duplicate files, stale DB records, or album merges without explicit user modal approval
- Implemented LibraryDoctorScreen dashboard with health score gauge, category filter chips, expandable issue cards, Fix All Safe Issues action, BPM half/double-time adjustment dialog, and issue detail modal
- Added LibraryDoctor destination to SideMenuDestination, added Library Doctor entry under MUSIC in SideNavigationDrawer, and connected direct access from LibraryHealthScreen
- Created comprehensive LibraryDoctorTest unit test suite covering all 12 categories, preferences lifecycle, embedded artist splitting, duplicate distinction, and safe repair dispatch

### Summary of fixes

- Added constructor DAO overrides (trackDaoOverride, brainDaoOverride) to LibraryDoctorAuditor and LibraryDoctorRepairManager to allow clean JVM unit testing without abstract RoomDatabase proxies
- Refined album consistency matcher to strip bracketed/parenthesized release years and preserve raw whitespace for comparison
- Added missing Healing icon and verticalScroll imports
